If anything, expand this program to allow for more people to take it rather than cut it. I realize you\'re running a business here, and Cap U is operating at a deficit, but look for other ways to save money rather than cutting valuable educational programs that actually genuinely do what they are supposed to do.

School of Business students have ideas but often need help on the Web or mobile development side. We just started some innovative cross-disciplinary courses like mobile app commercialization co-taught by faculty from both areas. Students asked why we can\'t have more courses like this and more collaboration with Interactive Design. I\'m embarrassed to tell them that rather than having more of these kind of cross-disciplinary efforts with talented Interactive Design students and instructors, we won\'t be having any if this gets cut. Cutting the program would be a big step backwards. It\'s taken years to get the curriculum and approach right. It won\'t be something that can just be broken up and restored in pieces in different program areas. It\'s value is in its integrated nature. Every post-secondary institution needs a program like Interactive Design, it\'s core to the growing knowledge economy. Ironically in the School of Business we are working hard to come up with new program offerings in areas like e-marketing, social media etc. It will take a lot of time, effort, and cost and what we come up very likely won\'t be any better than what we already have in the Interactive Design program. With some business courses added in, there would be huge potential to give our grads a much better chance at employability in the growing Web and mobile sector.',

What we need to grow this potential is a government that is willing to invest in the education, training and mentoring of the future digital generation. The biggest issues facing academic institutions in this regard is keeping pace with the blistering speed in which this industry advances. I have seen the results of Capilano Univeristy\'s Interactive Design program. They graduate students with real world skills; high demand skills that our technology, creative and gaming industries seek. They are job ready with the skills to begin work in any number of digital disciplines. If we truly want to grow and nurture the future of economic and technological advancement of this province, we need to think carefully about the types of skill sets that are needed for British Columbia to compete on a global level -- and to really put our support behind growing those skills.',

        var heroBoxes = []
            .concat($scope.quoteBoxes)

        $scope.heroBoxes = heroBoxes.sort(function(a,b) { return parseFloat(a.priority) - parseFloat(b.priority) } );

});
